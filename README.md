My take on C++ modules from 42 school.

I also wrote [an article which explains the algorithm](https://dev.to/emuminov/human-explanation-and-step-by-step-visualisation-of-the-ford-johnson-algorithm-5g91) that you need to implement in the last, and the hardest, C++ exercise, cpp09/ex02.

There is a [tester](https://github.com/emuminov/ford-jonson-tester) for the cpp09/ex02 btw!
